## About

Simon Says is a memory game where the player must repeat increasingly long sequences of tones and colors. Each round, a new step is added to the sequence, and the player must replicate it by clicking the colored buttons in the correct order.

This project is a web-based version of that game, designed to run in a browser with a clean and responsive interface.
